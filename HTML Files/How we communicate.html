            <p>We like to keep in touch with our friends and relatives. But it is not always possible to visit them. So how can we stay in touch with our loved ones? We can write letters, make phone calls, send e-mails, or even advertise in newspapers, radio or on television. Sending and receiving messages is called communication. Long ago, trained pigeons carried messages from one place to another. People went on foot or on animals to deliver messages. But all this was slow and not so reliable. Today, we have several faster and most reliable means of communication.</p>
            <h3>PERSONAL COMMUNICATION</h3>
            <p>We can choose how we want to communicate with a person or with a few people. This is called personal communication. Here are some ways we communicate with others.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Postal Services: </b>The cheapest and most popular means of communication is a letter. We get inland letters, postcards and stamped envelopes in a post office. The postal service of our country is called India post. There are nearly 1,55,015 post offices throughout the country. We can write messages and post them in letterboxes in our towns and cities. These letters are then carried by road, rail, air or water transport to different cities and countries. They reach their destination in a few days. If we want letters and parcels to reach someone very quickly, we use speed post. Through speed post, letters, parcels can reach any part of the country in two or three days. We can also send money to someone through the post office.</li>

                <li><b>Telephone: </b>A telephone is the fastest means of communication. On the telephone, we can easily talk to a friend or relative in our city, in another city or even in another country. Mobile phones allow us to communicate even while we are travelling. We can also send an SMS (Short Message Service) through mobile phones.
                Nowadays, there are mobile phones that have many features. They are called Smartphones or mini computers. We can use smartphones to make and receive calls, send and receive messages, clicking photographs and recording videos, listen to music, watching songs and movies and surfing the Internet.</li>

                <li><b>Fax: </b>The fax is used to send a written document or a photograph. It reaches instantly since it is connected to a telephone line. Most offices have a fax machine.</li>

                <li><b>Internet and E-mail: </b>The Internet has made communication much faster and more efficient people use it on their computers, laptops, tablets or smartphones. They read e-books, send messages, see photographs and watch videos over the Internet. Many people also use email to keep in touch with relatives, friends and co-workers. An email is very fast and can be sent anywhere.</li>

                <h3>MASS COMMUNICATION</h3>
                <p>When a message or some information has to be delivered to a large number of people, it is called mass communication. Newspapers, magazines, radio and television are a few examples. These help in communicating with a large number of people at the same time. A newspaper gives us detailed news of events taking place in our country as well as in the world. Radio and television provide the latest news on important events. They give us the daily weather forecast too. Besides, we can listen to or watch a variety of programmes. All these latest means of communication have brought the helped world closer to connect people better.</p>
